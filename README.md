##Compound Data Structure Drills

This is another set of drills I used to practice using iterations to search through compound data structures. My code is divided into two parts, each with its own seed data structure.

###Part 01

Contains Ruby code that answers the following questions:

* How many people are in `people` (excluding children)?
* What are the names of all the people?
* What is the phone number of Alia O'Conner PhD?
* How many children does Brian Heller have?
* What company does Dr. Adela DuBuque work for?
* What are the names of the people who have children?
* What are the names of the people who do not have children?
* What is Brian Heller's child's name?
* What is Maryse Johns' first child's name?
* Dr. Adela DuBuque just had a baby named Tomas. How would you update the hash for this information?

###Part 02

Contains Ruby code that answers the following questions:

* How many people are in the first set of people?
* How many people are in the second set of people?
* What is Ruby Hessel's phone number?
* What are the names of Dr. Sigrid Nader's children?
* What is Bernard Feil's child's name?
* What company does Casandra Kemmer work for?
* Who are all the people in the first set that have an `m` in their company names?
